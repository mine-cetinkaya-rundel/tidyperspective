# principles of the tidyverse

## tidyverse

::: columns
::: {.column width="80%"}
-   meta R package that loads eight core packages when invoked and also bundles numerous other packages upon installation
-   tidyverse packages share a design philosophy, common grammar, and data structures

## setup

**Data:** Thousands of loans made through the Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending platform available in the **openintro** package, with a few modifications.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)

loans <- loans_full_schema %>%
  mutate(
    homeownership = str_to_title(homeownership), 
    bankruptcy = if_else(public_record_bankrupt >= 1, "Yes", "No")
  ) %>%
  filter(annual_income >= 10) %>%
  select(
    loan_amount, homeownership, bankruptcy,
    application_type, annual_income, interest_rate
  )
```

## start with a data frame

```{r}
loans
```

## tidy data

1.  Each variable forms a column
2.  Each observation forms a row
3.  Each type of observational unit forms a table

## task: calculate a summary statistic

::: goal
Calculate the mean loan amount.
:::

```{r}
loans
```

. . .

```{r}
#| eval: false

mean(loan_amount)
```

. . .

```{r}
#| error: true
#| echo: false

mean(loan_amount)
```

## accessing a variable

**Approach 1:** With `attach()`:

```{r}
attach(loans)
mean(loan_amount)
```

. . .

<br>

*Not recommended.* What if you had another data frame you're working with concurrently called `car_loans` that also had a variable called `loan_amount` in it?

```{r}
#| echo: false
detach(loans)
```

## accessing a variable

**Approach 2:** Using `$`:

```{r}
mean(loans$loan_amount)
```

. . .

<br>

**Approach 3:** Using `with()`:

```{r}
with(loans, mean(loan_amount))
```

## accessing a variable

**Approach 4:** The tidyverse approach:

```{r}
loans %>%
  summarise(mean_loan_amount = mean(loan_amount))
```

. . .

-   More verbose
-   But also more expressive and extensible

## the tidyverse approach

-   tidyverse functions take a `data` argument that allows them to localize computations inside the specified data frame

-   does not muddy the concept of what is in the current environment: variables always accessed from within in a data frame without the use of an additional function (like `with()`) or quotation marks, never as a vector

. . .

-   **Good:** Inputs and outputs are data frames
-   **Not so good:** Need to introduce
    -   formula syntax

    -   passing functions as arguments

    -   merging datasets

    -   square bracket notation for accessing rows

## grouped summary with `tapply()`

```{r}
sort(
  tapply(loans$loan_amount, loans$homeownership, mean),
  decreasing = TRUE
  )
```

. . .

<br>

**Not so good:**

-   passing functions as arguments
-   distinguishing between the various `apply()` functions
-   ending up with a new data structure (`array`)
-   reading nested functions

## task: data visualization

::: goal
Create side-by-side box plots that shows the relationship between loan amount and application type, faceted by homeownership.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

-   Each layer produces a valid plot

boxplot(loan_amount ~ application_type, 
        data = loans1, main = levels[1])
boxplot(loan_amount ~ application_type, 
        data = loans2, main = levels[2])
boxplot(loan_amount ~ application_type, 
        data = loans3, main = levels[3])

## further customizing `ggplot()`

## beyond wrangling, summaries, visualizations

Modeling and inference with **tidymodels**:

-   A unified interface to modeling functions available in a large variety of packages

-   Sticking to the data frame in / data frame out paradigm

-   Guardrails for methodology

# pedagogical strengths of the tidyverse

## consistency

-   No matter which approach or tool you use, you should strive to be consistent in the classroom whenever possible

-   tidyverse offers consistency, something we believe to be of the utmost importance, allowing students to move knowledge about function arguments to their long-term memory

## teaching consistently

-   Challenge: Google and Stack Overflow can be less useful -- demo problem solving

-   Counter-proposition: teach *all* (or multiple) syntaxes at once -- trying to teach two (or more!) syntaxes at once will slow the pace of the course, introduce unnecessary syntactic confusion, and make it harder for students to complete their work.

-   "Disciplined in what we teach, liberal in what we accept"

:::

## mixability

-   Mix with base R code or code from other packages

-   In fact, you can't not mix with base R code!

## scalability

Adding a new variable to a visualization or a new summary statistic doesn't require introducing a numerous functions, interfaces, and data structures

## user-centered design

-   Interfaces designed with user experience (and learning) in mind

-   Continuous feedback collection and iterative improvements based on user experiences improve functions' and packages' usability (and learnability)

## readability

Interfaces that are designed to produce readable code

## community

-   The encouraging and inclusive tidyverse community is one of the benefits of the paradigm

-   Each package comes with a website, each of these websites are similarly laid out, and results of example code are displayed, and extensive vignettes describe how to use various functions from the package together

## shared syntax

Get SQL for free!

# final thoughts

## building a curriculum

-   Start with `library(tidyverse)`

-   Teach by learning goals, not packages

## keeping up with the tidyverse

-   Lifecycle stages and badges:

    ![](images/lifecycle.png)

-   Blog posts highlight updates, along with the reasoning behind them and worked examples
