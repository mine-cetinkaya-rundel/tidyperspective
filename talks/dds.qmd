# principles of the tidyverse

## tidyverse

::: columns
::: {.column width="80%"}
-   meta R package that loads eight core packages when invoked and also bundles numerous other packages upon installation
-   tidyverse packages share a design philosophy, common grammar, and data structures

## setup

**Data:** Thousands of loans made through the Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending platform available in the **openintro** package, with a few modifications.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)

loans <- loans_full_schema |>
  mutate(
    homeownership = str_to_title(homeownership), 
    bankruptcy = if_else(public_record_bankrupt >= 1, "Yes", "No")
  ) |>
  filter(annual_income >= 10) |>
  select(
    loan_amount, homeownership, bankruptcy,
    application_type, annual_income, interest_rate
  )
```

## start with a data frame

```{r}
loans
```

## tidy data

1.  Each variable forms a column
2.  Each observation forms a row
3.  Each type of observational unit forms a table

## task: calculate a summary statistic

::: goal
Calculate the mean loan amount.
:::

```{r}
loans
```

. . .

```{r}
#| eval: false

mean(loan_amount)
```

. . .

```{r}
#| error: true
#| echo: false

mean(loan_amount)
```

## accessing a variable

**Approach 1:** With `attach()`:

```{r}
attach(loans)
mean(loan_amount)
```

. . .

<br>

*Not recommended.* What if you had another data frame you're working with concurrently called `car_loans` that also had a variable called `loan_amount` in it?

```{r}
#| echo: false
detach(loans)
```

## accessing a variable

**Approach 2:** Using `$`:

```{r}
mean(loans$loan_amount)
```

. . .

<br>

**Approach 3:** Using `with()`:

```{r}
with(loans, mean(loan_amount))
```

## accessing a variable

**Approach 4:** The tidyverse approach:

```{r}
loans |>
  summarise(mean_loan_amount = mean(loan_amount))
```

. . .

-   More verbose
-   But also more expressive and extensible

## the tidyverse approach

::: incremental
-   tidyverse functions take a `data` argument that allows them to localize computations inside the specified data frame

-   does not muddy the concept of what is in the current environment: variables always accessed from within in a data frame without the use of an additional function (like `with()`) or quotation marks, never as a vector

```
:::

. . .

-   **Good:** Inputs and outputs are data frames
-   **Not so good:** Need to introduce
    -   formula syntax

    -   passing functions as arguments

    -   merging datasets

    -   square bracket notation for accessing rows

## grouped summary with `tapply()`

```{r}
sort(
  tapply(loans$loan_amount, loans$homeownership, mean),
  decreasing = TRUE
  )
```

. . .

<br>

**Not so good:**

-   passing functions as arguments
-   distinguishing between the various `apply()` functions
-   ending up with a new data structure (`array`)
-   reading nested functions

## task: data visualization

::: goal
Create side-by-side box plots that shows the relationship between loan amount and application type, faceted by homeownership.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-width: 12

ggplot(loans, 
         aes(x = application_type, y = loan_amount)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~ homeownership) +
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18) +

. . .

-   Each layer produces a valid plot
-   Faceting by a third variable takes only one new function

## plotting with `boxplot()`

```{r}
levels <- sort(unique(loans$homeownership))
levels

loans1 <- loans[loans$homeownership == levels[1],]
loans2 <- loans[loans$homeownership == levels[2],]
loans3 <- loans[loans$homeownership == levels[3],]
```

## plotting with `boxplot()`

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))

boxplot(loan_amount ~ application_type, 
        data = loans1, main = levels[1])
boxplot(loan_amount ~ application_type, 
        data = loans2, main = levels[2])
boxplot(loan_amount ~ application_type,
