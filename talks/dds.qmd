# final thoughts

## pedagogical strengths of the tidyverse

| Concept              | Description                                                                                                |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Consistency          | Syntax, function interfaces, argument names, and orders follow patterns                                    |
| Mixability           | Ability to use base R and other functions within the tidyverse                                             |
| Scalability          | Unified approach to data wrangling and visualization works for datasets of a wide range of types and sizes |
| User-centered design | Function interfaces designed and improved with users in mind                                               |
| Readability          | Interfaces that are designed to produce readable code                                                      |
| Community            | Large, active, welcoming community of users and resources                                                  |
| Transfarability      | Data manipulation verbs inherit from SQL's query syntax                                                    |
