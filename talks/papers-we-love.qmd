# principles of the tidyverse

## tidyverse

::: columns
::: {.column width="80%"}
-   meta R package that loads eight core packages when invoked and also bundles numerous other packages upon installation
-   tidyverse packages share a design philosophy, common grammar, and data structures

## setup

**Data:** Thousands of loans made through the Lending Club, a peer-to-peer lending platform available in the **openintro** package, with a few modifications.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(openintro)

loans <- loans_full_schema %>%
  mutate(
    homeownership = str_to_title(homeownership), 
    bankruptcy = if_else(public_record_bankrupt >= 1, "Yes", "No")
  ) %>%
  filter(annual_income >= 10) %>%
  select(
    loan_amount, homeownership, bankruptcy,
    application_type, annual_income, interest_rate
  )
```

## start with a data frame

```{r}
loans
```

## tidy data

1.  Each variable forms a column
2.  Each observation forms a row
3.  Each type of observational unit forms a table

## task: calculate a summary statistic

::: goal
Calculate the mean loan amount.
:::

```{r}
loans
```

. . .

```{r}
#| eval: false

mean(loan_amount)
```

. . .

```{r}
#| error: true
#| echo: false

mean(loan_amount)
```

## accessing a variable

**Approach 1:** With `attach()`:

```{r}
attach(loans)
mean(loan_amount)
```

. . .

<br>

*Not recommended.* What if you had another data frame you're working with concurrently called `car_loans` that also had a variable called `loan_amount` in it?

```{r}
#| echo: false
detach(loans)
```

## accessing a variable

**Approach 2:** Using `$`:

```{r}
mean(loans$loan_amount)
```

. . .

<br>

**Approach 3:** Using `with()`:

```{r}
with(loans, mean(loan_amount))
```

## accessing a variable

**Approach 4:** The tidyverse approach:

```{r}
loans %>%
  summarise(mean_loan_amount = mean(loan_amount))
```

. . .

-   More verbose
-   But also more expressive and extensible

## the tidyverse approach

::: incremental
-   tidyverse functions take a `data` argument that allows them to localize computations inside the specified data frame

-   does not muddy the concept of what is in the current environment: variables always accessed from within in a data frame without the use of an additional function (like `with()`) or quotation marks, never as a vector

# teaching with the tidyverse

## task: grouped summary

::: goal
Based on the applicants' home ownership status, compute the average loan amount and the number of applicants.
Display the results in descending order of average loan amount.

  arrange(desc(avg_loan_amount)) %>%
  mutate(
    n_applicants = number(n_applicants, big.mark = ","),
    avg_loan_amount = dollar(avg_loan_amount, accuracy = 1)
    ) %>%
  kable(
    col.names = c("Homeownership", "Number of applicants", "Average loan amount"),
    align = "lrr"
    )

## putting it back together

::: in-out
**\[input\]** data frame
:::

```{r}
loans %>%
  group_by(homeownership) %>% 
  summarize(
    avg_loan_amount = mean(loan_amount),
    n_applicants = n()
    ) %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_loan_amount))
```

::: in-out
**\[output\]** data frame
:::

## grouped summary with `aggregate()`

```{r}
res1 <- aggregate(loan_amount ~ homeownership, 
                  data = loans, FUN = length)
res1

names(res1)[2] <- "n_applicants"
res1
```

## grouped summary with `aggregate()`

```{r}
res2 <- aggregate(loan_amount ~ homeownership, 
                  data = loans, FUN = mean)
names(res2)[2] <- "avg_loan_amount"

res2
```

. . .

```{r}
res <- merge(res1, res2)
res[order(res$avg_loan_amount, decreasing = TRUE), ]
```

## grouped summary with `aggregate()`

::: small
```{r}
#| eval: false

res1 <- aggregate(loan_amount ~ homeownership, data = loans, FUN = length)
names(res1)[2] <- "n_applicants"
res2 <- aggregate(loan_amount ~ homeownership, data = loans, FUN = mean)
names(res2)[2] <- "avg_loan_amount"
res <- merge(res1, res2)
res[order(res$avg_loan_amount, decreasing = TRUE), ]
```
:::

. . .

-   **Good:** Inputs and outputs are data frames
-   **Not so good:** Need to introduce
    -   formula syntax

    -   passing functions as arguments

    -   merging datasets

    -   square bracket notation for accessing rows

## grouped summary with `tapply()`

```{r}
sort(
  tapply(loans$loan_amount, loans$homeownership, mean),
  decreasing = TRUE
  )
```

. . .

<br>

**Not so good:**

-   passing functions as arguments
-   distinguishing between the various `apply()` functions
-   ending up with a new data structure (`array`)
-   reading nested functions

## and...

many more comparative examples in the paper

## pedagogical strengths of the tidyverse

![](images/table1.png){fig-alt="Table 1 from paper: Consistency: Syntax, function interfaces, argument names and orders follow patterns; Mixability: Ability to use base and other functions within tidyverse syntax; Scalability: Unified approach to data wrangling and visualization works for datasets of a wide range of types and sizes; User-centered design: Function interfaces designed with users in mind; Readability: Interfaces that are designed to produce readable code; Community: Large, active, welcoming community of users and resources; Transferability: Data manipulation verbs inherit from SQL’s query syntax." fig-align="center"}

> We are all converts to the tidyverse and have made a conscious choice to use it in our research and our teaching.
> We each learned R without the tidyverse and have all spent quite a few years teaching without it at a variety of levels from undergraduate introductory statistics courses to graduate statistical computing courses.
> This paper is a synthesis of the reasons supporting our tidyverse choice, along with benefits and challenges associated with teaching statistics with the tidyverse.
